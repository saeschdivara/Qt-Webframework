# Contributing

Bug fixes and patches from 3rd party contributors are always welcomed.

## Getting started

* Please make sure you have a GitHub account
* Please look into the driver issue tracker on GitHub for similar/identical issues
* For bugs: if the bug you found is not yet described in an existing issue, please file a new one. The new issue should include a clear description of the bug and how to reproduce it (including your environment)
* For feature requests: please clearly describe the proposed feature, additional configuration options, and side effects
* Please let us know if you plan to work an a ticket. This way we can make sure we avoid redundant work

* Create a fork our repository. You can use GitHub to do this
* Make sure the unmodified clone works locally before making any code changes. You can do so by running the included test suite (i.e. make unittests)

## Making Changes

* Create a new branch in your fork
* Develop and test your modifications there
* Commit as you like, but preferrably in logical chunks. Use meaningful commit messages and make sure you do not commit unneccesary files (e.g. object files). It is normally a good idea to reference the issue number from the commit message so the issues will get updated automatically with comments
* When done, run the complete test suite and make sure all tests pass
* When finished, push the changes to your GitHub repository and send a pull request from your fork to the Qt-Web-Framework repository. Please make sure to select the appropriate branches there
* You must use the MIT License for your changes
